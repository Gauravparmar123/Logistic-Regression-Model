Logistic Regression Model
A clean and modular Python implementation of logistic regression for binary classification tasks. This project demonstrates the full machine learning workflow‚Äîfrom data preprocessing and model training to evaluation and visualization‚Äîusing scikit-learn and pandas.
üöÄ Features
- Binary classification using logistic regression
- Data preprocessing with handling of missing values and categorical encoding
- Train-test split and model training
- Performance metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, ROC-AUC
- Confusion matrix and ROC curve visualization
- Easily extendable for multi-class classification

This project is ideal for:
- Understanding the fundamentals of supervised learning
- Practicing model evaluation techniques
- Building a foundation for more advanced classifiers like SVM or neural networks
